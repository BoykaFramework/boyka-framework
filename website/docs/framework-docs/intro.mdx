## What is Boyka Framework?

Boyka Framework is an open source Test Automation Framework written in Java that supports automating Web, API, and Mobile (Android and iOS applications) seamlessly.

## Why Boyka Framework was created?

Throughout my career in automating APIs, web browsers, and mobile apps, I noticed that using different frameworks for each type of automation created a lot of confusion and made managing dependencies and code harder.

Additionally, I never found a test automation framework that allowed us to write scripts without needing to set up a lot of project-specific boilerplate code.

Learning multiple frameworks also slowed down teams, increasing the time it took to write automation tests and adding to automation debt.

This inspired me to create a single framework‚ÄîBoyka‚Äîthat solves these problems by allowing QA teams to automate across APIs, Web, and Mobile apps more efficiently and with less overhead.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Zero boilerplate code
- ‚úÖ Boyka command line assistant for one step installation and setup
- ‚úÖ Support Rest API automation with schema validations and response body verification
- ‚úÖ Supports Web browser automation with support for Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari.
- ‚úÖ Supports Android native and hybrid apps automation
- ‚úÖ Supports iOS native and hybrid apps automation
- ‚úÖ Allow Multi-user Multi-platform session interactions like testing a multi-platform chat application
- ‚úÖ Supports execution of Web tests on cloud platforms like BrowserStack and LambdaTest
- ‚úÖ Highly configurable via `boyka-config.json`
- ‚úÖ Micro logging to log events of the test execution
- ‚úÖ Supports taking screenshots
- ‚úÖ Highly extensible via listeners for integrating with available Reporters
- ‚úÖ Supports any available test frameworks like TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber, etc.
- ‚úÖ Support video recording of the tests for Mobile platforms

## ‚è±Ô∏è Coming soon...

Following are the awesome features which will be implemented soon to the frameworks:

- Support for GraphQL and SOAP API automation
- Support video recording of the tests for Web platforms
- Support for more cloud platforms
- Many many more...
