## üëã Welcome to Boyka Framework!

In my career having vast experience in automating API, Web browsers and Mobile apps, I have seen that people had to use different frameworks for automating API, Web and Mobile applications which created a lot of chaos with respect to maintenance of dependencies and their respective code for test automation.

Also, I never came across a test automation framework which allowed us to write automation test script without any project specific boilerplate code or a mini framework.

In addition to this, there was learning curve involved for learning those individual frameworks which slowed down the team to write automation and thus increased overall automation debt.

This all gave me an idea of having a single framework which could solve all the above mentioned problems and help the QA's to keep the pace up with writing test scripts and reduce the automation debt.

Following are some of the features of Boyka Framework:

- ‚úÖ Zero boilerplate code
- ‚úÖ Support Rest API automation with schema validations and response body verification
- ‚úÖ Supports Web browser automation with support for Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari.
- ‚úÖ Supports Android native and hybrid apps automation
- ‚úÖ Supports iOS native and hybrid apps automation
- ‚úÖ Allow Multi-user Multi-platform session interactions like testing a multi-platform chat application
- ‚úÖ Supports execution of Web tests on cloud platforms like BrowserStack and LambdaTest
- ‚úÖ Highly configurable via `boyka-config.json`
- ‚úÖ Micro logging to log events of the test execution
- ‚úÖ Supports taking screenshots
- ‚úÖ Highly extensible via listeners for integrating with available Reporters
- ‚úÖ Supports any available test frameworks like TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber, etc.
- ‚úÖ Support video recording of the tests for Mobile platforms

## ‚è±Ô∏è Coming soon...

Following are the awesome features which will be implemented soon to the frameworks:

- Support for GraphQL and SOAP API automation
- Support video recording of the tests for Web platforms
- Support for more cloud platforms
- Many many more...
