# Introduction

Welcome to Boyka Framework!

Boyka framework is an ultimate test automation framework, which handles all the platforms in a single framework, like API, Web, Android and iOS applications.

## Why create yet another framework?

From my past experience, I found that most frameworks required to write some boilerplate code in order to get started with a new project.

Boyka was created with the aim to simplify writing tests on any project you may work on. That means, no need to write any boilerplate code, just write your tests and run them.

Boyka also helps in writing simple page objects for your application where you can specify locators for Web, Android and iOS applications, and it will automatically use the appropriate locator when running your tests.
