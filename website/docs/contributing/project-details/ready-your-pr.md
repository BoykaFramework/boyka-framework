Once you have updated reviewers feedback in your PR. You need to demonstrate your feature development to the Maintainers and Repo owners by showing your worknig code along with the tests.

This Demo would be taking place on [Discord][join-discord]:
1. Send a message on `#contributor-discussion` channel and schedule a time accordingly to demo your work. 
2. Once your demo is scheduled, you would be given temporary access to `#open-office` channel on Discord which you can use for demonstrating your work.

## Merge PR

If everything is fine, wait for `boyka-core` team to merge your PR. Most of the time, we will merge your PR as soon as we approve it. It's very rare that we won't merge your PR immediately after approving it.

Don't merge approved PR yourself. Instead, tag the `boyka-core` team to the PR comments.
